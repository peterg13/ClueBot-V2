# ClueBot-V2
Digital version of the scorecard from the game Clue that also helps you win!

This is the same project as the other ClueBot however I decided to take a different approach as the other version is made using Django which I do not feel suits the needs of the project.

The program will have a column for each type of card and the players (my family). TODO: add ability to add custom players.

To play you just select the cards you want.  If you have confirmed they are not winning cards you can choose remove and it will mark them red.  If you see that a player has a card you can do both remove and add to player.  If you don't see any cards but you see other players show their cards to someone else you can mark them down as well.

All of this will be kept in a list at the bottom so you can see the likely chance that the player has the card to help you make an informed decision to the winning cards.
